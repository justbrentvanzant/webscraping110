Ministry Projects A young attorney once asked Jesus a test question in an attempt to entrap him. “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus responded with a question of his own. “You know the Law. How do you read it? Sum it up in one sentence.” The young attorney quickly answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.” (Luke 10:25-29 and Mark 10:17) Jesus complimented the attorney on his succinct answer and told him to do just as he had answered. One of the characteristics of our society today is the rapid decline of a sense of community in tandem with an epidemic of autonomy. One does not have to travel far to do mission work; many opportunities are available in every community. Wherever God has placed you is your mission field and even closer to “home” are those who sit next to you in class every day. Remember that we are told to start at home (Jerusalem), then work with interfacing cultures (Judea and Samaria), and then distant cultures (ends of the earth). 4. Witness “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” Acts 1:8 Every one of us is a witness for Jesus Christ. The question is, “Are we effective?” Student chapters should consider evangelism as individuals and as a chapter. The chapter should be a source of strength and encouragement for personal outreach. There is another facet to our Christian witness: The individual who sees himself/herself called by God and who knows Jesus Christ as the Lord of all creation is vitally concerned about this world and its values and priorities. Our witness involves not only a verbal declaration of the saving power of Jesus Christ, but a promotion of Christian alternatives to secularism and other “isms” which are dehumanizing and degrading to man. The Christian view of life has more than a passing relevance to a discipline concerned with life, death, and the person. A chapter genuinely concerned with its witness must seek to let its light radiate forth in the midst of the healthcare community, piercing every facet. 5. Worship “Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth. Worship the LORD with gladness; come before him with joyful songs. Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture. Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name. For the LORD is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.” Psalm 100 Though worship may not be the primary goal of our student chapter, it will be difficult to meet regularly as Christians and not spend some time worshiping our Heavenly Father. Worship will often unify a student chapter as no other activity can, and it is greatly encouraged where ever Christians gather."
